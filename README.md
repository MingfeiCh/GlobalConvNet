# GlobalConvNet

1. Implementation of Global Convolutional Network in 'CVPR 2017 Large Kernel Matters —— Improve Semantic Segmentation by Global Convolutional Network'

2. Implementation of Channel-wise attention in 'ECCV 2018 Cbam: Convolutional block attention module'


## spatial- and channel-wise attention

You can multi the output of GCN (out_channel=1) and the output of CA to get spatial- and channel-wise attention maps.
